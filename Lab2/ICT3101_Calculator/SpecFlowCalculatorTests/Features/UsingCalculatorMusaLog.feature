Feature: UsingCalculatorMusaLog

In order to conquer divisions
As a division enthusiast
I want to understand a variety of division operations
@MusaLog
Scenario: Calculate failure intensity
	Given I have a calculator
	When I have entered 10 as initial failure intensity and 0.02 as decay perimeter and 50 expected failure into the calculator and press Musa Log failure intenstiy
	Then the Log failure intensity result should be 3.68
@MusaLog
Scenario: Calculate number of expected failure
	Given I have a calculator
	When I have entered 0.02 as decay and 10 as initial failure intensity and 10 as the time and press Musa Log expected Number Failure
	Then the log expected failure result should be 55
